# dRally

The main goal of this project is to create a port of Death Rally (1996) running natively on Linux and BSD based operating systems.

#### Nintendo 3DS port (branch `3ds`)

This branch adds a native Nintendo 3DS port of the engine - no SDL shim, it uses SDL2's own n3ds
backend, writes the 8 bit screen straight into the double buffered framebuffer, feeds the DSP at its
native 32728 Hz, translates the pad into the engine's keyboard scancodes (fully remappable through
`dr3_controls.txt`) and uses the otherwise unused bottom screen for the controls, the current driver
standings and - during a race - a minimap of the track with every car on it.

* **installation, controls and configuration: [INSTALL_3DS.md](INSTALL_3DS.md)**
* technical notes, measurements and the profiler build: [doc/3ds.md](doc/3ds.md)
* build scripts: [scripts/3ds](scripts/3ds)

This branch contains **no game data** and is **not affiliated with Remedy Entertainment**.  Like the
Linux port it needs the files of an original Death Rally copy (see below for the layout).

#### Linux requirements
* GCC/Clang C compiler
* GNU/Make
* SDL2


#### Building

```sh
FLAGS="YOUR CFLAGS" make
```

#### Installation - needs original game assets

* [Death Rally registered free windows version CHIP](https://www.chip.de/downloads/Death-Rally-Vollversion_38550689.html)

```sh
7z e -o drally DeathRallyWin_10.exe
cd drally && mkdir CINEM && mv ENDANI* CINEM && mv SANIM* CINEM
echo "./CINEM" &> CDROM.INI
```

Only versions including the DR.IDF file are able to use the `FLAGS += -DDR_CDCHECK`

    Make sure these file/dir names in dRally directory are in uppercase.

    [1] CDROM.INI contains relative location of CINEM directory (./CINEM)
